# Advent of Code

monorepo for my solutions to the Advent of Code.

To run a solution, please put the session cookie inside a file named SESSION
in the repository so it can automatically fetch the input for you.

Alternatively, you can put the input inside input/YYYY-MM.txt and it will not
fetch anything. In that case, you still need SESSION to exist, so do this:

```bash
touch SESSION
```
